## SymOxide: Intermediate Representation and Transformations for Computer Algebra Systems

SymOxide has taken many design decisions from
[Pymbolic](https://github.com/inducer/pymbolic) and could be called as
Rust-rewrite of Pymbolic.

Symoxide does indeed lead to faster expression traversals (with upto 20x
speedups) with similar LOCs in the downstream.
