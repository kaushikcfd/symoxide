## SymOxide: Intermediate Representation and Transformations for Computer Algebra Systems

SymOxide has taken many design decisions from
[Pymbolic](https://github.com/inducer/pymbolic) and could be called as
Rust-rewrite of Pymbolic.

Symoxide does indeed lead to [faster expression
traversals](https://gist.github.com/kaushikcfd/74c442a075557dad466cd3daea9c151f)
with similar LOCs in the downstream.
